| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **IP Address or Hostname** | The system's IP address or DNS host name. |
| **Nickname** | Required short-form identifier for this system. You cannot use system nicknames more than once. |
| **Password / API Key** | New password or API key. TrueCommand hides characters for security. |
| **Password / API Key Confirm** | Re-enter the password or API key. |

Click **RESET FORM** to clear the fields and reset the form if you make a mistake. Click **ADD SYSTEM** to add the new system. Click **ADD AND CONTINUE** to add this system and then continue to add more systems.

## Managing Systems in TrueCommand UI

To display the list of systems in TrueCommand, click the <span class="material-icons">settings</span> icon and select either **System Inventory** or **Systems**.

The **Systems** menu has two tabs: **Systems** and **System Groups**.
These tabs contain all the options to connect and organize systems in TrueCommand.
TrueCommand lists all added systems and their connection statuses in the **Systems** tab.

To connect a new system, click **+ NEW SYSTEM**. Enter the system IP address or DNS host name, then enter a system nickname and password. Click **RESET FORM** to clear the fields and reset the form if you make a mistake.

Clicking the more details icon <span class="material-icons">more_vert</span> allows you to enter new connection details for a system in the list.

## Adjusting Systems using the TrueCommand UI

Misconfigured systems (such as one created with an incorrect password) appear offline on both the TrueCommand **Dashboard** and **Systems** list.

To enter new connection details for a system in the list, click the more details icon <span class="material-icons">
more_vert
</span>. Click **RESET FORM** to clear the fields and reset the form if you make a mistake. To remove a system from TrueCommand monitoring, click **Delete**.

## Organizing Systems into Groups using the TrueCommand UI

TrueCommand administrators can organize systems into collections called *groups*. Grouping systems enables efficient system permissions and reporting management.

Open the **System Groups** tab to view the list of created groups and the systems they contain.
Create a group by clicking **Configure <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i>&nbsp; > Systems > + NEW GROUP**.
Enter a name for the new group and click **ADD SYSTEM** to add a system to the group.
After you add all the desired systems to the group, click **SAVE GROUP**.

Editing a group allows you to update the group name or change which systems are members of that group.

To delete a system group, click **Delete** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Delete">delete</i>.
Click **Yes** to confirm the deletion.
