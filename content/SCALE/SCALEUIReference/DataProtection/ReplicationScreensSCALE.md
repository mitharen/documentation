The **Replication Task** widget on the **Data Protection** screen lists replication tasks configured on the TrueNAS system. Replication tasks work with periodic snapshot tasks to complete the replication.

![ReplicationAndPeriodicSnapshotTasksWidgets](/images/SCALE/22.02/ReplicationAndPeriodicSnapshotTasksWidgets.png "Data Protection Replication Task Widget") 

The **Replication Tasks** widget displays **No Replication Tasks configured** before you add a task.

![ReplicationTasksWidgetNoTasks](/images/SCALE/22.02/ReplicationTasksWidgetNoTasks.png "Data Protection Replication Task Widget No Tasks") 

The **Replication Task** widget heading is a link that opens the **[Data Protection > Replications Tasks](#replication-tasks-list-screen)** list view screen.

**Add** opens the **[Add Replication Task](#add-replication-task-wizard)** wizard. 

Each replication task is a link to open the **[Edit Replication Task](#edit-replication-task-screen)** screen.

The widget displays the status of a task as **PENDING**, **RUNNING**, **SUCCESS** or **FAILED**. 
Click on the status to open a **Logs** window where you can see details on the task and download the log file.

The **[<span class="material-icons">play_arrow</span> Run Now](#run-now-option)** icon opens a dialog.

## Add Replication Task Options
There are two ways to add a replication task, the wizard and the advanced creation screen. 
These two methods share many settings. The section below describe each setting.
Some settings shared by the wizard and the advanced creation screen display more related setting options. 
These separate sections document the shared settings to make finding the information easier:
* **[Encryption](#encryption-setting-options)**
* **[Also include snapshots with the name]()**
* [Schedule](#replication-schedule-options)

**Add**, or if no replication task exist, **Add Replication Tasks** open the wizard.

## Add Replication Task Wizard
The wizard has two screens. 
* **What and When** settings specify the task name, data source and destinations, the type of replication (local or remote), transport options (SSH connection).
* **When** setting specify when to run the task. 

**Advanced Replication Creation** on the **What and When** screen opens the advanced replication creation screen.

### What and When Wizard Screen
The **What and When** screen options specify a previous replication task, source and destination information and a name for the task. 
The **[Encryption](#encryption-setting-options)** option, used in both the replication task wizard and advanced creation screen, displays more options based on the selection made.
The **[Source Location](#source-and-destination-options)** and **[Destination Location](#destination-location-setting-options)** selections each display more options based on the selection made.
The **[SSH Connection](#ssh-settings)** option displays for both source and destination if the location setting is **On a Different System**.
The **[Also include snapshots with the name](#snapshot-naming-options)** options display in both the wizard and advanced creation screen but different replicating snapshots settings related to naming result in them displaying.

A schedule field displays after selecting **Replicate Specific Snapshots**. Again, select a preset schedule or **Custom** to use the advanced scheduler. |
| **Begin** | Displays after selecting **Replicate Specific Snapshots**. Select a time range for the specific periodic snapshots to replicate, in 15 minute increments. Periodic Snapshots created before this selected time are not included in the replication. |
| **End** | Displays after selecting **Replicate Specific Snapshots**. Select a time range for the specific periodic snapshots to replicate, in 15 minute increments. Periodic Snapshots created after this selected time are not included in the replication. |
| **Periodic Snapshot Tasks** | Select the snapshot schedule for this replication task from the dropdown list. Select from previously configured periodic snapshot tasks. This replication task must have the same **Recursive** and **Exclude Child Dataset** values as the selected periodic snapshot task. Selecting a periodic snapshot schedule removes the **Schedule** field. |
| **Also include snapshots with the name** | These radio buttons change the naming schema setting option below it. See [Snapshot Naming](#snapshot-naming-options) in the wizard section for details on this option and the radio buttons. |
| **Matching naming schema** | Displays the **Also Include Naming Schema** setting. |
| **Matching regular expression** | Displays the **Matching regular expression** setting. |
| **Also Include Naming Schema** | Displays after selecting the **Matching naming schema** radio button. Enter the pattern of naming custom snapshots to include in the replication with the periodic snapshot schedule. Enter the [strftime(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html) strings that match the snapshots to include in the replication. When a periodic snapshot is not linked to the replication, enter the naming schema for manually created snapshots. Has the same %Y, %m, %d, %H, and %M string requirements as the **Naming Schema** in a **Add Periodic Snapshot Task**. Separate entries by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. |
| **Matching regular expression** | Displays after selecting the **Matching regular expression** radio button. Enter the regular expressions snapshot should match. Using this option replicates all snapshots with names matching the specified regular expression. This process reads snapshot metadata to determine snapshot creation order. This slows regular performance on the systems with large number of snapshots. |
| **Save Pending Snapshots** | Select to prevent source system snapshots that have failed replication from being automatically removed by the **Snapshot Retention Policy**. |

| **Run Automatically** | Select to either start this replication task immediately after the linked periodic snapshot task completes.  |
| **Schedule** | Select to create a replication schedule if not selecting **Run Automatically**. Displays the **Frequency**, **Begin**, **End** and **Only Replicate Snapshots Matching Schedule** options. |
| **Frequency** | Displays after selecting **Schedule**. Select a preset schedule or choose **Custom** to use the advanced scheduler. |
| **Begin** | Displays after selecting **Schedule**. Select the start time for the replication task. |
| **End** | Displays after selecting **Schedule**. Select the end time for the replication task. A replication that is already in progress can continue to run past this time. |
| **Only Replicate Snapshots Matching Schedule** | Displays after selecting **Schedule**. Select to use the **Schedule** in place of the **Replicate Specific Snapshots** time frame. The **Schedule** values are read over the **Replicate Specific Snapshots** time frame. |

## Edit Replication Task Screen
The **Edit Replication Task** screen displays most of the settings found on the advanced **[Add Replication Task](#advanced-replication-creation-screen)** screen with a few exceptions.

* **[General](#general-and-transport-options-settings)** settings do not include the **Direction** option. 
  The **Transport** is setting on the edit screen are the same setting as the [advanced creation](#general-and-transport-options-settings) settings.
* **[Source](#advanced-source-options)** and **[Destination](#advanced-destination-options)** setting options are the same as the advanced creation settings.
* **[Replication Schedule](#replication-schedule-advanced-options)** setting options are the same as the advanced creation settings.

See the section linked above for information on the **Edit Replication Task** screen settings.
