The **View Enclosure** screen displays an image of the TrueNAS-provided system hardware with drive images you can select. 
The screen includes information on system pools, disks and their status, HDD details and stats that change with the drive you select on the system image.
Based on the system hardware, the screen provides additional display and information options that reflects the system hardware model using TrueNAS SCALE.

To access the **System > View Enclosure** screen, either click the image on the main dashboard or go to **System Settings > Enclosure>**.
