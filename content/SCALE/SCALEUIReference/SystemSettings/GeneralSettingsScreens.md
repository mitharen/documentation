The TrueNAS SCALE **System Settings > General** screen includes widgets for **[Support](#support-widget)**, **[GUI](#gui)**, **[Localization](#localization)**, and **[NTP](#ntp-servers)** functions.   

![SystemGeneralScreen](/images/SCALE/22.02/SystemGeneralScreen.png "System General Screen") 

**[Manage Configuration](#manage-configuration-screens)** provides three options to backup, restore, or reset system configuration settings.

## Manage Configuration Screens

TrueNAS SCALE allows users to manage the system configuration via uploading/downloading configurations or resetting the system to the default configuration. 

### Download File Window

The **Download File** option opens the **Save Configuration** window. This allows you to download the TrueNAS SCALE current configuration for your system to the local machine.

![SystemGeneralSaveConfiguration](/images/SCALE/22.02/SystemGeneralSaveConfiguration.png "System General Download Save Configuration") 

The **Export Password Secret Seed** includes encrypted passwords in the downloaded configuration file. This allows you to restore the configuration file to a different operating system device where the decryption seed is not already present. Users must physically secure configuration backups containing the seed to prevent unauthorized access or password decryption.

### Upload File Window

The **Upload File** option opens the **Upload Config** window with the **Choose File** option that lets you replace the current system configuration with any previously saved TrueNAS SCALE configuration file.

![SystemGeneralUploadConfig](/images/SCALE/22.02/SystemGeneralUploadConfig.png "System General Upload Config") 

**Choose File** opens a file browser window where you can locate the downloaded and saved configuration. After selecting the file it displays in the **Upload Config** window. 
**Upload** uploads the selected configuration file.

{{< hint danger >}}
All passwords are reset if the uploaded configuration file was saved without the selecting **Export Password Secret Seed**.
{{< /hint >}}

### Reset to Defaults Window

The **Reset to Defaults** option opens the **Reset Configuration** window. This resets the system configuration to factory settings and restarts the system. Users must set a new login password.

![SystemGeneralResetConfiguration](/images/SCALE/22.02/SystemGeneralResetConfiguration.png "SCALE General Reset Configuration") 

{{< hint danger >}}
**Save the system current configuration with the _Download File_ option before resetting the configuration to default settings.**
 
If you do not save the system configuration before resetting it, you may lose data that was not backed up, and you will not be able to revert to the previous configuration.
