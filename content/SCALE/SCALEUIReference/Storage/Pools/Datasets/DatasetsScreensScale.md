The **Datasets** screen and widgets display information about datasets, provide access to data management functions, indicate the dataset roles and what services use the dataset, show the encryption status, and the permissions the dataset has in place. 
The screen focus is on managing data storage including user and group quotas, and snapshots and other data protection measures. 

The **Datasets** screen displays **No Datasets** with a **Create Pool** button in the center of the screen until you add a pool and the first root dataset.

![DatasetsScreenBeforeAddingAPool](/images/SCALE/22.12/DatasetsScreenBeforeAddingAPool.png "Datasets Screen Add Pool") 

After creating a dataset, the left side of the screen displays a tree table that lists parent or child datasets (or zvols). The **Details for *datasetnam*** area on the right side of the screen displays a set of dataset widgets.

![DatasetsScreenAfterAddingAPool](/images/SCALE/22.12/DatasetsScreenAfterAddingAPool.png "Datasets Screen With a Pool") 

**Import Data** opens the **[Import Data]({{< relref "ImportDataScreenSCALE.md" >}})** screen. 

**Add Zvol** opens the **[Add Zvol]({{< relref "ZvolsScreensScale.md" >}})** screen.

**Add Dataset** opens the **[Add Dataset](#add-or-edit-dataset-screens)** screen.

## Dataset Tree Table

The datasets tree table lists datasets in an expandable hierarchical structure with the root dataset first, which is followed by direct child or non-root parent datasets with their child datasets nested under them. 
{{< expand "Click Here for More Information" "v" >}}
Click on any root or non-root parent dataset to expand the tree table.
Click on any dataset to select it and display the dataset widgets for that dataset.

![DatasetsScreenTreeTableExpanded](/images/SCALE/22.12/DatasetsScreenTreeTableExpanded.png "Dataset Tree Table")

The table includes storage space used and available for that dataset, encryption status (locked, unlocked, or unencrypted), and the role of that dataset or what service uses it (i.e., the system dataset, a share, virtual machine, or application). 

### Tree Table Encryption

## Add and Edit Dataset Screens

The **Add Dataset** and **Edit Dataset** screens include the same settings but you cannot change the dataset **Name**, **Share Type** or **Case Sensitivity** settings after you click **Save** on the **Add Dataset** screen. 
After adding a dataset, to edit encryption options use the **Edit** button on the **ZFS Encryption** widget.

There are two screen options, **Basic Options** and **Advanced Options**. 
The **Advanced Options** screen include all the settings found on the **Basic Options** screen.

The **Basic Options** include three sections: **[Name and Options](#name-and-options-settings)**, **[Encryption Options](#encryption-options-settings)** and **[Other Options](#other-option-settings---advanced-options)**.

The **Advanced Options** settings include quotas management tools for **This Dataset** and **This Dataset and Child Datasets**, and includes more **Other Options** settings not available on the **Basic Options** screen.

### Name and Options Settings

These settings are common to both the **Basic Options** and **Advanced Options** screens. 
Setting include name, path and other general settings.
{{< expand "Click Here for More Information" "v" >}}

![AddDatasetNameAndOptions](/images/SCALE/22.12/AddDatasetNameAndOptions.png "Add Dataset Name and Options") 

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Parent path** | Read-only field that displays the dataset path for the dataset. The root dataset path includes the only the name of the root dataset. Child datasets created from a child of root include the root dataset/parent dataset in the path. |
| **Name** | Enter a unique identifier for the dataset. You cannot change the dataset name after clicking **Save**. |
| **Comments** | Enter notes about the dataset. |
| **Sync** | Select the sync setting option from the dropdown list. **Standard** uses the sync settings requested by the client software. **Always** waits for data writes to complete, and **Disabled** never waits for writes to complete. |
| **Compression level** | Select the compression algorithm to use from the dropdown list. Options encode information in less space than the original data occupies. It is recommended to choose a compression algorithm that balances disk performance with the amount of saved space.<br> **LZ4** is generally recommended as it maximizes performance and dynamically identifies the best files to compress.<br> **ZSTD** is the [Zstandard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8478) compression algorithm with several options for balancing speed and compression.<br> **Gzip** options range from **1** for least compression with best performance, through **9** for maximum compression with greatest performance impact.<br> **ZLE** is a fast algorithm that only eliminates runs of zeroes.<br>**LZJB** is a legacy algorithm that is not recommended for use. |
| **Enable Atime**| Select the access time for files option from the dropdown list. Access time can result in significant performance gains. **Inherit** uses the access time setting of the parent or the root dataset. **On** updates the access time for files when they are read. **Off** disables creating log traffic when reading files to maximize performance. |

### Encryption Options Settings

The encryption setting options are the same on the **Basic Options** and **Advanced Options** screens. **Encryption Options** only display on the **Add Dataset** screen. 
To change encryption settings use the **Edit** button on the **ZFS Encryption** widget.
{{< expand "Click Here for More Information" "v" >}}
The default setting is **Inherit** selected. Clearing the checkbox displays the key encryption options. 

![AddDatasetEncrytionOptionsInherit](/images/SCALE/22.12/AddDatasetEncrytionOptionsInherit.png "Add Dataset Encryption Options") 
 
Clear the **Inherit(*non-encrypted*)** checkbox to display additional settings.

![AddDatasetEncryptionOptionsInheritCleared](/images/SCALE/22.12/AddDatasetEncryptionOptionsInheritCleared.png "Add Dataset Encryption Options Clear Inherit") 
 
Selecting other options changes the settings displayed.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Inherit (non-encrypted)** | Select to clear the checkmark to display more encryption settings. |
| **Encryption** | Select to clear the checkmark and remove the encryption settings from the **Add Dataset** screen. If the root dataset is not encrypted, leaving **Inherit (non-encrypted)** selected is the same as clearing the **Encryption** checkbox. |

#### Edit Encryption Settings

### Other Options Settings - Basic Options

The **Other Options** help tune the dataset for specific data sharing protocols, but the **Basic Options** settings only includes a small subset of the settings found on the **Advanced Options** screen.
{{< expand "Click Here for More Information" "v" >}}

![AddDatasetOtherOptions](/images/SCALE/22.12/AddDatasetOtherOptions.png "Add Dataset Basic  Other Options")

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **ZFS Deduplication** | Select the option from the dropdown list to transparently reuse a single copy of duplicated data to save space. Options are **Inherit** to use the parent or root dataset settings. **On** to use deduplication. **Off** to not use deduplication, or **Verify** to do a byte-to-byte comparison when two blocks have the same signature to verify the block contents are identical.<br> Deduplication can improve storage capacity, but is RAM intensive. Compressing data is recommended before using deduplication.<br> Deduplicating data is a one-way process. *Deduplicated data cannot be undeduplicated!* |
| **Case Sensitivity** | Select the option from the dropdown list. **Sensitive** assumes file names are case sensitive. **Insensitive** assumes file names are not case sensitive. You cannot change case sensitivity after the saving the dataset. |
| **Share Type** | Select the option from the dropdown list to define the type of data sharing the dataset uses to optimize the dataset for that sharing protocol. Select **SMB** if using with an SMB share. Select **Generic** for all other share types. You cannot change this setting after the saving dataset. |
{{< /expand >}}

### Quota Management Settings - Advanced Options
The **This Dataset** and **This Dataset and Child Datasets** sections include the same setting options. 
These settings also display on the **[Capacity Settings]({{< relref "CapacitySettingsSCALE.md" >}})** screen.
{{< expand "Click Here for More Information" "v" >}}
To apply the settings to only the parent dataset you are creating, enter settings in the **This Dataset** fields. 
To apply settings to both the parent dataset and any new child datasets you create from this dataset, enter settings in the **This Dataset and Child Datasets** section. 

![AddDatasetQuotasManagement](/images/SCALE/22.12/AddDatasetQuotasManagement.png "Add Dataset Advanced Quota Options") 

Setting a quota defines the maximum allowed space for the dataset or the dataset and child datasets.
You can also reserve a defined amount of pool space to prevent automatically generated data like system logs from consuming all of the dataset space.
You can configure quotas for only the new dataset or include all child datasets.

{{< include file="/_includes/DatasetQuotaSettings.md" type="page" >}}

{{< /expand >}}

### Other Option Settings - Advanced Options
Many of the **Other Options** settings inherit their values from the parent dataset.
{{< expand "Click Here for More Information" "v" >}}
The **Basic Options** screen shares the **ZFS Deduplication**, **Case Sensitivity** and **Share Type** settings. All other settings in this section are unique to the **Advanced Options** screen.

![AddDatasetOtherOptionsAdvanced1](/images/SCALE/22.12/AddDatasetOtherOptionsAdvanced1.png "Add Dataset Advanced Other Options") 

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **ZFS Deduplication** | Select the option from the dropdown list. Options are **Inherit (off)**, **on**, **verify**, and **off**. Transparently reuse a single copy of duplicated data to save space. Deduplication can improve storage capacity, but is RAM intensive. Compressing data is generally recommended before using deduplication. Deduplicating data is a one-way process. Deduplicated data cannot be undeduplicated! |
| **Checksum** | Select the [checksum](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Basic%20Concepts/Checksums.html) option from the dropdown list. Select **Inherit** to use the parent setting; **On** to use checksum without specifying the variant; **FLETCHER2** (deprecated) or **FLETCHER4** to use a position-dependent checksum that uses two checksums to determine single-bit errors in messages transmitted over network channels or ZFS streams; **SHA256** (default for dedupted datasets) or **SHA512** to use a sequence of numbers and letters to check the copy of a downloaded update file is identical to the original; **SKEIN** which is not supported for a file system on boot pools; or **EDNOR** which is not supported for file systems on boot pools and Edon-R requires verification when used with dedup so it automatically uses `verify`. |
| **Read-only** | Select the option to allow or prevent dataset modification from the dropdown list. **On** prevents modifying the dataset. **Off** allows users accessing the dataset to modify its contents. |
| **Exec** | Select the option for executing processes from within the dataset from the dropdown list. **On** allows executing processes from within this dataset. **Off** prevents executing processes from with the dataset. We recommend setting it to **On**. |
| **Snapshot directory** | Select the option to controls visibility of the <file>.zfs</file> directory on the dataset from the dropdown list. Select either **Visible** or **Invisible**. |
| **Snapdev** | Select the option that controls whether the volume snapshot devices under /dev/zvol/*poolname* are hiddin or visible from the dropdown list. Options are **Inherit (hidden)**, **Visible** and **Hidden** (default value). |

![AddDatasetOtherOptionsAdvanced2](/images/SCALE/22.12/AddDatasetOtherOptionsAdvanced2.png "Add Dataset Advanced Other Options 2") 

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Copies** | Select the number of duplicate of ZFS user data stored on this dataset from the dropdown list. Select between **1**, **2**, or **3** redundant data copies. This can improve data protection and retention, but is not a substitute for storage pools with disk redundancy. |
| **Record Size** | Select the logical block size in the dataset from the dropdown list of options. Matching the fixed size of data, as in a database, can result in better performance. |
| **ACL Type** | Select the access control list type from the dropdown list of options. **Inherit** preserves ACL type from the parent dataset.<br>**Off** to use neither NFSv4 or POSIX protocols.<br>**NFSv4** is used to losslessly migrate Windows-style ACLs across Active Directory domains (or stand-alone servers) that use ACL models richer than POSIX. Since POSIX ACLs are a Linux-specific ZFS feature, administrators should use NFSv4 to maintain compatibility with TrueNAS Core, FreeBSD, or other non-Linux ZFS implementations. <br>**POSIX** use when an organization data backup target does not support native NFSv4 ACLs. Since the Linux platform used POSIX for a long time, many backup products that access the server outside the SMB protocol cannot understand or preserve native NFSv4 ACLs. All datasets within an SMB share path must have identical ACL types.<br>For a more in-depth explanation of ACLs and configurations in TrueNAS SCALE, see our [ACL Primer]({{< relref "/content/References/ACLPrimer.md" >}}). |
| **ACL Mode** | Select the option that determines how [chmod](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chmod) behaves when adjusting file ACLs from the dropdown list. See the [zfs(8)](https://linux.die.net/man/8/zfs) `aclmode` property.<br> **Passthrough** only updates ACL entries that are related to the file or directory mode.<br> **Restricted** does not allow chmod to make changes to files or directories with a non-trivial ACL. An ACL is trivial if it can be fully expressed as a file mode without losing any access rules. Set the ACL Mode to restricted to optimize a dataset for SMB sharing, but it can require further optimizations. For example, configuring an [rsync task]({{< relref "RsyncTasksSCALE.md" >}}) with this dataset could require adding `--no-perms` in the task **Auxiliary Parameters** field. |
| **Case Sensitivity** | Select the option that sets whether filenames are case sensitive. Select **Sensitive** to assume filenames are case sensitive, or **Insensitive** to assume filenames are not case sensitive. Noted: The **Mixed** option no longer exists. |
| **Metadata (Special) Small Block Size** | Enter a threshold block size for including small file blocks into the [special allocation class (fusion pools)]({{< relref "FusionPoolsScale.md" >}}). Blocks smaller than or equal to this value are assigned to the special allocation class while greater blocks are assigned to the regular class. Valid values are zero or a power of two from 512B up to 1M. The default size **0** means no small file blocks are allocated in the special class. Before setting this property, you must add a [special class VDEV]({{< relref "FusionPoolsScale.md" >}}) to the pool. |
| **Share Type** | Select the option from the dropdown list to define the type of data sharing the dataset uses to optimize the dataset for that sharing protocol. Select **SMB** if using with an SMB share. Select **Generic** for all other share types. You cannot change this setting after the saving dataset. |
