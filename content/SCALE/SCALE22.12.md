## Obtaining the Release

To download an <file>.iso</file> file for installing SCALE Bluefin, go to https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/ and click **Download**.
Manual update files are also available at this location.

To upgrade an existing SCALE install, log in to your SCALE web interface and go to **System Settings > Update**.

{{< hint warning >}}
SCALE is developed as an appliance that uses specific Linux packages with each release. Attempting to update SCALE with `apt` or methods other than the SCALE web interface can result in a nonfunctional system.

### Alderlake GPU Support

TrueNAS SCALE Bluefin includes Linux Kernel 5.15 which can enable Alderlake GPU acceleration by using the following boot loader tunable and rebooting:

`midclt call system.advanced.update '{"kernel_extra_options": "i915.force_probe=4690" }'`

`4690` can be replaced with your specific Alderlake GPU version.

## 22.12-RC.1

**November 15, 2022**

TrueNAS SCALE 22.12-RC.1 has been released and includes many new features and improved functionaltiy. SCALE 22.12-RC.1 features include:

* Adds FIPS-validated SSL module (Enterprise Only)
* Adds the R50M to the Enclosure screen
* Adds USB passthrough support and allows users to specify USB vendor/product IDs in the UI
* Adds increased functionality in the new Storage screens that include overprovisioning on zpool creation and the ability to see the full name for datasets with long names
* Adds support for creating S3 buckets in Cloud Sync Backups
* Updates Kubernetes to 1.25 and Samba to 4.17.0.rc5

{{< hint info >}}
SCALE 22.12-RC.1 introduces a change in Applications. Users upgrading to 22.12-RC.1 now use the [Docker overlay2 driver](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/) instead of ZFS. This change brings a considerable performance boost to applications but applications installed in 22.12-RC.1 are incompatible with any previous version of SCALE 22.12.

### Notice

MinIO has removed backwards compatibility with version 2022-10-24_1.6.58.

MinIO fails to deploy if you update your version 2022-10-24_1.6.58 Minio app to 2022-10-29_1.6.59 or later using the TrueNAS web UI. Use the app roll back function and return to 2022-10-24_1.6.58 to make your MinIO app functional again.
See the [MinIO Migration documentation](https://min.io/docs/minio/kubernetes/upstream/operations/install-deploy-manage/migrate-fs-gateway.html#procedure) to manually update your MinIO app to the latest version without losing functionality.

This is a security protection on the part of Windows as Basic Authentication is considered an insecure way to input passwords. While the Windows Registry can be edited to allow for basic authentication, this is not recommended. It is recommended to access WebDAV shares using a browser with https security enabled or mounting shares with Digest Authentication enabled. | N/A |
| 22.12-BETA.2 | n/a | TrueNAS Bluefin no longer supports MS-DOS based SMB clients. | As of SCALE 22.12, Bluefin, TrueNAS now uses Samba 4.17. Samba 4.16 announced in their release notes that they deprecated and disabled the whole SMB1 protocol as of 4.11. If needed for security purposes or code maintenance they continue to remove older protocol commands and unused dialects or that are replaced in more modern SMB1 version. Refer to [Samba](https://www.samba.org/samba/latest_news.html) release notes for more information. | n/a |

This issue looks to implement a solution using TrueCommand and TrueNAS API that provides the ability to have shared volumes that do not occupy all nodes in the cluster, add one or more nodes to a cluster without impacting existing shared volumes, "grow" a shared volume, and temporarily remove nodes from a cluster without destroying the cluster. | Targeted Backlog |
