Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) DNS authenticators allows users to automate certificate issuing and renewal. The user must verify ownership of the domain before certificate automation is allowed.

The system requires an ACME DNS Authenticator and CSR to configure ACME certificate automation.

To add an authenticator,

Click **Add** on the **ACME DNS-Authenticator** widget to open the **Add DNS Authenticator** screen.

Enter a name, and select the authenticator you want to configure. The selection changes the screen settings.

If you select **[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com)** as the authenticator, you must enter your Cloudflare account email address, API key, and API token. 

If you select **[Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)** as the authenticator, you must enter you Route53 Access key ID and secret access key.

Click **Save** to add the authenticator.
