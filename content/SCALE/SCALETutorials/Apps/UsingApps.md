Both pre-built official containers and custom application containers can be deployed using the **Applications** page in the SCALE web interface.

The UI asks to use a storage pool for applications.

![AppsSettingsChoosePool](/images/SCALE/22.02/AppsSettingsChoosePool.png "Choosing a Pool for Apps")

We recommend users keep the container use case in mind when choosing a pool.
Select a pool that has enough space for all the application containers you intend to use.
TrueNAS creates an *ix-applications* dataset on the chosen pool and uses it to store all container-related data.

You can find additional options for configuring general network interfaces and IP addresses for application containers in **Apps > Settings > Advanced Settings**.

## Official Applications

Official containers are pre-configured to only require a name during deployment.

![AppPlexApplicationWizard](/images/SCALE/22.02/AppPlexApplicationWizard.png "Plex App Wizard Application Name")

A button to open the application web interface displays when the container is deployed and active.

Users can adjust the container settings by editing a deployed official container.
Saving any changes redeploys the container.
